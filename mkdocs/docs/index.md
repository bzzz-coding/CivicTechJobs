# Welcome to the Civictechjobs.org Wiki!

Here, you'll find all the essential information about our project. This wiki is designed to be a helpful resource for both new and existing team members.

## Project Definition

CivicTechJobs will be a site to find open volunteer positions for projects at Hack for LA.

## Introduction To The Project

### What is Civictechjobs.org?

Civic Tech Jobs is a platform designed to connect prospective Hack for LA volunteers with interdisciplinary projects that align with their career goals while driving positive civic impact. The custom-built CMS enables this by allowing projects to list required skills and then matching volunteers based on their availability, skills, and program area.

### Why do it?

CTJ will tackle key challenges in project recruitment and organizational sustainability, with future development focused on connecting volunteers to opportunities that align with paid job postings.

### Hasn't it been done already?

Yes, there are recruitment issues on project boards. However, the process is cumbersome and involves multiple steps to match candidates with the right roles.

Read more about what lead up to us developing this project, at our [History](misc/history) page.

### So how is this different?

We aim to streamline the process so that Product Managers can efficiently post open opportunities within their team. Most importantly, we want to ensure that volunteers can easily find the right match with a project based on their skills and aspirations.

## Guiding Objectives

### What are our guiding objectives?

1. Enable product managers ability to post, edit, or close open positions on an easy to use instinctive site (CMS).
2. Assist potential volunteers to self-filter roles based on their availability.
3. Provide potential volunteers list of open roles with different projects that matches their skills, and interest.
