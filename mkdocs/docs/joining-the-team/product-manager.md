Each of the resources below can be considered a work-in-progress. These resources will evolve and adapt as the team and team needs change. Feel free to open an issue with a link to whichever resource needs improvement and a description of the suggested change.

1. Learn how we setup our [GitHub Kanban boards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CuRX6hhWzs8ydVCnl6OrGZ4LeVSk9X_pIzoKchAqFcU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xwpqk588zdpy) and please comment if there is anything in the document that is unclear.

2. This [Software Development Lifecycle Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emxhYv9N6KuCVrG-gnqkqHdGnjhm_Qvb/view?usp=sharing) is a sample of what the process is generally like at Hack for LA and each project is different.

3. Communicate with other product team members and leadership to discuss project priorities and strategic direction.

4. Review the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/37/views/4) and the [Product Management issues available on that board](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/37/views/7) to identify an actionable backlog item.

5. Review Hack for LA [Product Management Templates](https://github.com/hackforla/product-management/wiki#started).
